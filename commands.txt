ts helps you to catch type errors at compile time

to tsc globally: npm intstall -g typescript


in a project: npm init -y // to start a node project
              npm  intall typescript // to intall tsc
              npx tsc --init // makes ts config file 
              npx tsc -b // tsc build: converting ts code to js code that will give a .js and tsconfig.tsbuildinfo file
              now you can run the index.js file : node index.js 
              this freshly created index.js file will not contain any ts code


*** tsconfig file ***
1 target --> to which version ts compiler will compile the code 

2 the js files are auto genrated by ts compiler, so we dont need to push them to github
so to make our code less messy , we only push ts file and make seperate dir for ts and js file(.gitignore for js file is not good option)
we make src (source) folder for ts file and we make buit or dist(distribution) forlder for js file and 
give path to rootDir and outDir in tsconfig file

 
3 noImplicityAny--> avoid the implicit any warnging


4 removeComments --> weather to include comments in the final js file

*** how to run js file after changing the folder location
node tsconfig.tsbuildinfo
node dist/index.js
